            The Argentina national football team represents Argentina in men's
            international football and is administered by the Argentine Football
            Association, the governing body for football in Argentina. The team
            has appeared in six World Cup finals and has won two World Cups.
            <br />
            Argentina has also been very successful in the Copa América, winning
            it 15 times, most recently led by Lionel Messi in 2021, and is
            currently tied with Uruguay in most wins. The team also won the 1992
            FIFA Confederations Cup. Argentina is the most successful team in
            the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, having won it twice (1993 and
            2022).
            <br />
            As of 2022, Argentina holds the record for most official titles won
            by a men's national team (21).

            The first match ever recorded for Argentina was against Uruguay, on
            20 June 1902. The game was held in Montevideo and Argentina won 6–0.
            During the first years of its existence, the Argentina national team
            only played friendly matches against other South American teams. The
            reasons for this varied, including long travel times between
            countries and the interruption of World War I. La Selección
            (national team), also known as the Albicelestes (sky blue and
            whites), has appeared in five World Cup finals, including the first
            final in 1930, which they lost, 4–2, to Uruguay. Argentina won in
            their next final in 1978, beating the Netherlands, 3–1. Argentina,
            led by Diego Maradona won again in 1986, a 3–2 victory over West
            Germany. Argentina last reached the World Cup final in 2014, where
            it lost 1–0 to the Germany. Previous to this their last World Cup
            final was in 1990, which is also lost, 1–0, to West Germany by a
            much-disputed penalty. Argentina's World Cup-winning managers are
            César Luis Menotti in 1978, and Carlos Bilardo in 1986. Argentina
            has been very successful in the Copa América, winning it 15 times.
            The team also won the FIFA Confederations Cup and the Kirin Cup,
            both in 1992, the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions in 1993 and 2022,
            and the Nations' Cup in 1964. Argentina 'Olympic' team (with only
            three players of over 23 years of age included in the squad) won the
            Olympics football tournaments in Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008.
            Argentina also won seven of the 18 football competitions at the Pan
            American Games, winning in 1951, 1955, 1959, 1971, 1995, 2003 and
            2019. In March 2007, Argentina reached the top of the FIFA World
            Rankings for the first time.
